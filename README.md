# TORONTO OUTBREAKS PROJECT

## OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project is to conduct a thorough analysis of historical disease outbreak data in Toronto from 2014 to 2016. By examining key variables such as outbreak settings, types of outbreaks, causative agents, and outbreak durations, the project aims to identify patterns, trends, and risk factors associated with disease outbreaks during this period. The insights gained from this analysis will enable public health authorities to make informed decisions and implement proactive measures to mitigate the impact of future outbreaks.
